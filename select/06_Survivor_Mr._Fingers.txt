It seems so strange, life takes a sudden change
And you don't know exactly what to do
Should i cry out loud? (i ask myself)
Should i be real strong?
Should i throw my hands up in the air
I'm crying out to the world
Somebody help me (somebody help me please)
Somebody help me
Somebody help me
You shed a tear, but nothing seems to cheer
Twas once duo, and now it's only you
Survivor, sole survivor, sole survivor
When others fade away
Survivor, sole survivor, sole survivor
When others fade away
Somebody help me
Somebody hеlp me
Somebody help mе
Survivor, sole survivor, sole survivor
When others fade away
Survivor, sole survivor, sole survivor
When others fade away (when others fade away)
When others fade away (when others fade away)
When others fade away (when others fade away)
When others fade away (when others fade away)
When others fade away (when others fade away)
