I was sitting at the corner cafe
Looking across Montego Bay
I wanted to remember the perfect view
But I was looking at my watch
I was waiting for you
With secrets and your eyes that sing
With your soft skirt flowing in the wind
It's a picture that you always paint
Between the sinners and the saints

Is this water?
Am I drowning?
Is this water?

There's a boat out on the ocean.
There's a swimmer in the tide.
There's a nervous crowd that's watching
Hope he makes it to the other side...

Ah Ah
In this strange and new territory
I await your arrival
I'm strong when you stand next to me
I'll be your new world survivor

In a world that's changing
Nothing is what it seems
The old order is caving
Hold onto your dreams

You stand out like a beacon in the night
My ship is sailing by your true light
All around us everything falling
Everything falling

Is this water?
Am I drowning?
Is this water?

There's a boat out on the ocean.
There's a swimmer in the tide.
There's a nervous crowd that's watching
Hope he makes it to the other side...

Ah Ah
In this strange and new territory
I await your arrival
I'm strong when you stand next to me
I'll be your new world survivor

I see the promise of your light
As we sail across these dark oceans of change

Ah Ah
In this strange and new territory
I await your arrival
I'm strong when you stand next to me
I'll be your new world survivor
